The TCP chat room is a server-client application built using Python's socket and threading libraries. The server listens for client connections on a specified IP address and port. Each connected client is prompted to choose a unique username, which is used to identify them in the chat room. The server manages multiple clients simultaneously by using threads, allowing them to send and receive messages concurrently.

Messages sent by a client are broadcast to all connected clients. If a client disconnects, the server informs the remaining participants that the user has left the chat. The server handles all communication using the TCP protocol, ensuring reliable message delivery.
